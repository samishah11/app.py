The provided Python code sets up a Flask web application that integrates with the Ethereum blockchain using the web3.py library. Here's a breakdown of its components:
Notes:
Ensure that erc20_abi.json contains the ABI for the ERC-20 token contract.
Replace 'YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID' and 'your-secret-key' with your actual Infura project ID and a secure secret key, respectively.
Replace 'coingecko_api_key' with your actual CoinGecko API key.
The application uses sessions to store account information; ensure that session management is properly configured in your Flask application.
This setup provides a basic framework for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain through a Flask web application, allowing users to create accounts, check token balances, send transactions.
